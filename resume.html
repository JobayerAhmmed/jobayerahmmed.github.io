<strong>IIT Academic Automation System</strong><br>
<small>ASP.Net MVC | Entity Framework | Microsoft SQL Server</small>
<p>
  This web-based application was developed for the Institute of Information Technology (IIT), University of Dhaka. 
  It was developed for the collaboration of academic works among students, teachers, and program officers of IIT. 
  Students can know about courses, instructors, and course contents, teachers can manage course contents of 
  different programs, and program officers can manage students, teachers, and courses of different programs, 
  batches, and semesters.
